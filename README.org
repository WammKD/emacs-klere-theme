*** Why I Created Klere
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: why-i-created-klere
    :END:
Put simply, I wanted bright colors though without clashing. I like dark
themes and colors that seem more radiant; not like they cut through the
black/dark-gray in distinct lines, like pastels might, but would seem to
radiate from the dark, softy glowing.
#+HTML: <br>

So, putting colors together bit by bit, I came up with Klere; it's
bright but not in a way that overpowers its dark-gray background of the
other shades of gray that outline the other fixtures: vibrant colors for
highlight, grays for outlines; that's the hope, at least.

** How to Download/Install
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-downloadinstall
   :END:
Klere is on [[https://melpa.org/#/klere-theme][Melpa]]; you can install
it by running =M-x list-packages= in Emacs and searching for
=klere-theme= if you have the Melpa repository loaded by =Package=. If
you don't have the repository added -- yet --, you can find instructions
for how to add it at the [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#usage][Melpa
Github page]].
#+HTML: <br>
#+HTML: <br>
If you don't want to use either Melpa or Emacs's package manager, choose
a directory to store your themes in (or, at least, Klere in) -- such as
=~/.emacs.d/themes= -- and load them as so:
=(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")= in your
emacs init file. You can, then, load the theme via =customize= or adding
=(load-theme 'klere t)= to your init file, as well.
